# stepik-selenium-course
Auto testing samples with Selenium

This repository is intended to be a testbed, but some scripts may be really useful.

All the files here are the most interesting (to my mind) solutions for the course "Automation of testing with Selenium and Python" from "Stepik" platform which can be found here: https://stepik.org/course/575

All the solutions are provided "AS IS". You may use them without any restrictions.
